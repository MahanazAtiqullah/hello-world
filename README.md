# hello-world
My first repository

Hi! My name is Mahanaz! 

I am currently a sophomore at the University of Texas at Dallas studying Software Engineering! Currently, aside from my classes, I am trying to learn iOS development and generally expand my knowledge in my field! At this very moment, I am trying to learn how to use repositories, and maybe even connect with other fellow developers!

Thanks for reading!
