# hello-world
My first repository

Hi! My name is Mahanaz! 

I am currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas, expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2022! Currently, aside from my classes, I am trying to learn iOS development and generally expand my knowledge in my field! I have also been dabbling in Web App Dev to take on a side project with my friends. At this very moment, I am trying to learn how to use repositories, and maybe even connect with other fellow developers!

Thanks for reading!
